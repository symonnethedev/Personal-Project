                Located in Cala Llonga, a beautiful Ibizan resort-town with one
                of the island’s largest beaches, a picturesque setting and
                plenty of things to do in town. The four-bedroom villa itself
                adopts a contemporary style washed in white to accompany its
                beautiful modern interior. Guests will be able to enjoy the
                stunning panoramic views of the surrounding hills that evoke a
                sense of privacy amongst nature. The spacious, open-plan design
                makes spending time inside a pleasure while the expansive glass
                windows and sliding doors allow a great deal of light to shine
                through from the famous Ibizan sun. The luminous living area is
                luxuriously spacious, featuring a large, ultra-comfortable sofa,
                flat screen television attached to the wall and various dining
                tables. The American-style open kitchen features a bench island
                and is fully equipped with any appliance that one may need
                during their stay, and has access to the pool. The villa’s
                exterior is a perfect setting for spending quality time outside,
                featuring a gorgeous long pool with access from two bedrooms and
                the living room. The property also features a landscaped garden
                and a pine forest which contrast the beauty of the natural
                environment with the modernity of the luxurious villa. The
                family-friendly area boasts access to parasailing, a
                scuba-diving school, windsurfing and water-skiing activities for
                those that plan on keeping active on vacation while being
                strategically located close to Ibiza town for those who want to
                experience the famous Ibizan nightlife. Cala Llonga manages to
                maintain a quieter, more relaxed atmosphere, making it a perfect
                option for those who need a relaxing escape but also want plenty
                of fun options nearby.
