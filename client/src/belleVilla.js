        Located in Cala Llonga, a beautiful Ibizan resort-town with one of the
        island’s largest beaches, a picturesque setting and plenty of things to
        do in town. The four-bedroom villa itself adopts a contemporary style
        washed in white to accompany its beautiful modern interior. Guests will
        be able to enjoy the stunning panoramic views of the surrounding hills
        that evoke a sense of privacy amongst nature. The spacious, open-plan
        design makes spending time inside a pleasure while the expansive glass
        windows and sliding doors allow a great deal of light to shine through
        from the famous Ibizan sun. The luminous living area is luxuriously
        spacious, featuring a large, ultra-comfortable sofa, flat screen
        television attached to the wall and various dining tables. The
        American-style open kitchen features a bench island and is fully
        equipped with any appliance that one may need during their stay, and has
        access to the pool. The villa’s exterior is a perfect setting for
        spending quality time outside, featuring a gorgeous long pool with
        access from two bedrooms and the living room. The property also features
        a landscaped garden and a pine forest which contrast the beauty of the
        natural environment with the modernity of the luxurious villa. The
        family-friendly area boasts access to parasailing, a scuba-diving
        school, windsurfing and water-skiing activities for those that plan on
        keeping active on vacation while being strategically located close to
        Ibiza town for those who want to experience the famous Ibizan nightlife.
        Cala Llonga manages to maintain a quieter, more relaxed atmosphere,
        making it a perfect option for those who need a relaxing escape but also
        want plenty of fun options nearby.
